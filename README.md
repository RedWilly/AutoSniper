## AutoSniper - Be Safe from Honeypot

This isn't your grandma's trading bot. AutoSniper is built for speed and efficiency, designed to get you into the hottest new tokens on [Base Network](https://chainlist.org/chain/8453) before anyone else even blinks. 

**üõ°Ô∏è 70%+ Honeypot Protection:**

We've built in multiple layers of analysis to detect and avoid honeypot scams.  While no system is perfect, AutoSniper significantly reduces your risk compared to going in blind.

**üöÄ What it does:**

* **Constantly monitors** the Base blockchain for newly created trading pairs.
* **Analyzes in milliseconds:**
    * Checks for common honeypot patterns (low liquidity, suspicious ownership).
    * Identifies potential trading opportunities with a good risk/reward profile.
* **Executes lightning-fast trades** to secure your position (but only if it looks safe!).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:**

This bot is provided as-is, for educational purposes only. Using trading bots involves significant financial risk.  Do your own research, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
